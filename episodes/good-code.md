## Coding formatting and linting

Readable code - for others and our future selves - should be descriptive, cleanly 
and consistently formatted, and use sensible, descriptive names for variables, functions 
and modules. Furthermore, our code should be efficient and well designed.

Programs called formatters and linters can help us with the above. What do they 
do and how do they differ?

### Formatters

With a light touch, formatters ensure the code adheres to standard style guides without altering 
functionality. A style guide is a set of conventions that we agree upon with our 
colleagues or community, to ensure that people produce code which looks similar 
in style. For examples, check out the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) or 
the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for Python and R, respectively.

Good, consistent formatting makes the code easier to read and can prevent merge 
conflicts.

### Linters

The work of "linters" is a bit more heavy-handed. These programs can check your code 
for common programming errors, convoluted syntax, unnecessary complexity, unused code, 
performance bottlenecks and other violations of best practices. Often they can fix the 
issues they encounter, or suggest appropriate improvements otherwise.

### Improving your code

::: challenge

Install and use a formatter and a linter to improve the style of your code.

::: tab
### Python
[The program `ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) can both format _and_ lint 
Python code. [Install `ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/) from PyPI 
or conda. Don't forget to add it to your `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` or 
whichever file you use to define your dependencies.

**Formatting**

First, use the formatter. Note that the use without the `--check` flag `ruff` 
automatically changes your file. This is the default, because formatting does 
not change the behaviour of your code.

```bash
# Check for formatting
ruff format --check

# Fix formatting, if desired
ruff format
```

Do you agree with the default choices `ruff` made? You can 
[configure](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/tutorial/#configuration) `ruff` to follow 
your choices if you need to, but be aware that the defaults were chosen for a reason.

**Linting**

Next, try out the linter. While fixing formatting is usually harmless, linting 
fixes change your code on a deeper level. By default, `ruff` only advises you. 
To automatically apply the linting, you need an explicit `--fix` flag. This is 
because linting can touch the functionality of your code, so make sure to review 
the changes `ruff` makes.

```bash
# Check for linting
ruff check

# Fix linting, if desired
ruff check --fix
```

What is your opinion on the linting suggestions? Again, you can 
[configure](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/tutorial/#configuration) the details `ruff` 
pays attention to when linting. Did you learn something new about the Python language?

### R

The standard option for [formatting R code is `styler`](http://styler.r-lib.org/), for [linting it's `lintr`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/).

```R
# Install the formatter and linter.
install.packages(c("styler", "lintr"))
```

If the installation fails due to a missing `libxml-2.0` library, install it first (it's called `libxml2-dev` in Ubuntu) and re-run the installation.

**Formatting**

You will notice that both new packages are listed under the "Addins" menu in RStudio. Open an R file and use

```
Addins ➜ STYLER ➜ "Style active file".
```

Do you agree with the default choices that `styler` made? You can [configure](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/styler.html#invasiveness) `styler` to follow your choices if you need to, but be aware that the defaults were chosen for a reason. You can also configure it under

```
Addins ➜ STYLER ➜ "Set style".
```

**Linting**

Next, try out the linter with

```
Addins ➜ LINTR ➜ "Lint current file".
```

While fixing formatting is usually harmless, linting fixes change your code on a deeper level. Make sure to review the changes `lintr` makes.

What is your opinion on the linting suggestions? Again, you can [configure](https://lintr.r-lib.org/#usage) the details `lintr` pays attention to when linting. Did you learn something new about the R language?

### (Optional) Git pre-commit hooks

So far, formatting and linting were conscious choices: you have to remember to execute 
them yourself every once in a while. A more robust approach would be to take away this 
mental load and automate linting and formatting. This can be achieved through "git hooks", 
which are a set of scripts `git` can run every time a certain action is performed. Here 
we have a look at "pre-commit hooks" that check your code changes _before_ you commit them.

::: challenge

The amount of git pre-commit hook scripts can grow rather large on 
bigger projects. `pre-commit` manages your commit hooks and helper programs in a 
declarative way and makes them easy to share between collaborators.

Use a `git` pre-commit hook to run formatters and linters every time before a `git commit`.

::: tab
### Python
Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and add it to your `requirements.txt` or 
`pyproject.toml`.

Create a `pre-commit` config file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.14.8
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      # Possible choices: [ python, pyi, jupyter ]
      # Here we exclude Jupyter notebooks
      types_or: [ python, pyi ]

      # Comment _out_ to only check, not fix
      args: [ --fix ]

    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format

      # Comment _in_ to only check, not fix
      # args: [ --check ]

      # Possible choices: [ python, pyi, jupyter ]
      # Here we exclude Jupyter notebooks
      types_or: [ python, pyi ]
```

If you would want to run additional checks, you need to add a new `- repo:` entry 
to the `pre-commit` config file.

Make sure to add and commit this file to your `git` repository, so your collaborators 
will use the exact same configurations and versions.

```bash
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
git commit -m "add pre-commit hook for formatting and linting"
```

Install the new git hook.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

You can test your script by executing it manually.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

For updating your hooks to the latest version, run

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

and make sure to add and commit your updated config file.

### R

Install the package `precommit` and initialize it. ⚠️ This package is only supported 
on operating systems that are also officially supported by R. Please check the 
[R Download page](https://cran.rstudio.org/) which ones are eligible. Non 
long-term-stable (LTS) Ubuntu distributions, for example, are not. Installing and 
running `precommit` on non-supported operating systems will probably require 
extra manual work.

```R
install.packages("precommit")
precommit::use_precommit()
```

RStudio will open the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file for you to review. It will look 
something like this:

```yaml
# All available hooks: https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html
# R specific hooks: https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit

- be it fixing the code, or excluding certain lines from being checked - and commit 
again.


### Further reading: CI/CD

We went from running formatting and linting locally to automating the checks for 
every commit. This still leaves a margin for error since your collaborators will 
need to set up the git hooks first. The next line of defense against messy contributions 
is CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery).

It goes beyond the scope of this module, but you can set up your remote repository 
such that every push (or pull/merge request) triggers a set of checks. For GitHub it 
is named [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), while GitLab just calls 
it [CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/). It is useful beyond just code style; other 
common usecases include automated testing (even on different platforms, like Linux, Windows 
or MacOS), compilation and packaging, deployment, benchmarking, security checks... 
There is a whole [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) for reusing CI/CD 
recipes.

Usually the tools you use will supply instructions on how to run them in this automated way. 
Check out [`ruff` integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/) for Python, 
or [`lintr` integrations](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-github-actions) 
and [`styler` integrations](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples#style-package) for R.

## Modular coding 

### What is modularity?
Modularity refers to the practice of building software from smaller, self-contained, 
and independent elements. Each element is designed to handle a specific set of tasks, 
contributing to the overall functionality of the system.

Modular coding is explained in more detail in [these slides](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/digital-skills-slides/modules/good-practices-lesson/modular-code-slides){target="_blank"}.

### Writing functions
One of the best ways to improve your code and to make it more modular is to write functions. 
Functions allow you to automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than 
copy-and-pasting. Writing a function has four big advantages over using copy-and-paste:

1.  You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.

2.  As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.

3.  You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. 
updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

4.  It makes it easier to reuse work from project-to-project, increasing your productivity 
over time.

A good rule of thumb is to consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a 
block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code).

### Defining a function

::: tab

### Defining a function in R

Let's open a new R script file and call it functions-lesson.R.

The general structure of a function is:

```r
my_function <- function(parameters) {
  # perform action
  # return value
}
```

Let's define a function `fahr_to_kelvin()` that converts temperatures from
Fahrenheit to Kelvin:

```r
fahr_to_kelvin <- function(temp) {
  kelvin <- ((temp - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
  return(kelvin)
}
```

We define `fahr_to_kelvin()` by assigning it to the output of `function`. The
list of argument names are contained within parentheses.   Next, the
body of the function--the
statements that are executed when it runs--is contained within curly braces
(`{}`). The statements in the body are indented by two spaces. This makes the
code easier to read but does not affect how the code operates.

It is useful to think of creating functions like writing a cookbook. First you define 
the "ingredients" that your function needs. In this case, we only need one ingredient 
to use our function: "temp". After we list our ingredients, we then say what we will do 
with them, in this case, we are taking our ingredient and applying a set of mathematical 
operators to it.

When we call the function, the values we pass to it as arguments are assigned to
those variables so that we can use them inside the function. Inside the
function, we use a [return
statement](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/reference.html#return-statement){target="_blank"}
to send a result back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.
Calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:

```r
# freezing point of water
fahr_to_kelvin(32)
```

```output
[1] 273.15
```

```r
# boiling point of water
fahr_to_kelvin(212)
```
```output
[1] 373.15
```

### Defining a function in Python
Let's open a new Python script file and call it `functions-lesson.py` 

The general structure of a function is:

```python
def my_function(parameters):
  # perform action
  # return value
```

Let's define a function `fahr_to_kelvin()` that converts temperatures from
Fahrenheit to Kelvin:

```python
def fahr_to_kelvin(temp):
    kelvin = ((temp - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
    return kelvin 
```

We define `fahr_to_kelvin()` by using the `def` keyword. The
list of argument names are contained within parentheses.   

Next, the
body of the function--the
statements that are executed when it runs--is indicated with indentation. 
The statements in the body are indented by four spaces.

It is useful to think of creating functions like writing a cookbook. First you define 
the "ingredients" that your function needs. In this case, we only need one ingredient 
to use our function: "temp". After we list our ingredients, we then say what we will do 
with them, in this case, we are taking our ingredient and applying a set of mathematical 
operators to it.

When we call the function, the values we pass to it as arguments are assigned to
those variables so that we can use them inside the function. Inside the
function, we use a return statement
to send a result back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.
Calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:

```python
# freezing point of water
fahr_to_kelvin(32)
```

```output
[1] 273.15
```

```python
# boiling point of water
fahr_to_kelvin(212)
```
```output
[1] 373.15
```

## (Optional) Modularity in Python

::: challenge

Carefully review the following code snippet:

```python
def convert_temperature(temperature, unit):
    if unit == "F":
        # Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
        celsius = (temperature - 32) * (5 / 9)
        if celsius < -273.15:
            # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
            return "Invalid temperature"
        else:
            # Convert Celsius to Kelvin
            kelvin = celsius + 273.15
            if kelvin < 0:
                # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
                return "Invalid temperature"
            else:
                fahrenheit = (celsius * (9 / 5)) + 32
                if fahrenheit < -459.67:
                    # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
                    return "Invalid temperature"
                else:
                    return celsius, kelvin
    elif unit == "C":
        # Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
        fahrenheit = (temperature * (9 / 5)) + 32
        if fahrenheit < -459.67:
            # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
            return "Invalid temperature"
        else:
            # Convert Celsius to Kelvin
            kelvin = temperature + 273.15
            if kelvin < 0:
                # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
                return "Invalid temperature"
            else:
                return fahrenheit, kelvin
    elif unit == "K":
        # Convert Kelvin to Celsius
        celsius = temperature - 273.15
        if celsius < -273.15:
            # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
            return "Invalid temperature"
        else:
            # Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
            fahrenheit = (celsius * (9 / 5)) + 32
            if fahrenheit < -459.67:
                # Invalid temperature, below absolute zero
                return "Invalid temperature"
            else:
                return celsius, fahrenheit
    else:
        return "Invalid unit"
```

## (Optional): Writing good functions in R

::: challenge

## Challenge 1

Write a function called `kelvin_to_celsius()` that takes a temperature in
Kelvin and returns that temperature in Celsius.

Hint: To convert from Kelvin to Celsius you subtract 273.15

:::: solution

## Solution to challenge 1

Write a function called `kelvin_to_celsius` that takes a temperature in Kelvin
and returns that temperature in Celsius

```r
kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
 celsius <- temp - 273.15
 return(celsius)
}
```

::::

### Combining functions

The real power of functions comes from mixing, matching and combining them
into ever-larger chunks to get the effect we want.

Let's define two functions that will convert temperature from Fahrenheit to
Kelvin, and Kelvin to Celsius:

```r
fahr_to_kelvin <- function(temp) {
  kelvin <- ((temp - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
  return(kelvin)
}

kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
  celsius <- temp - 273.15
  return(celsius)
}
```

:::  challenge

## Challenge 2

Define the function to convert directly from Fahrenheit to Celsius,
by reusing the two functions above (or using your own functions if you
prefer).

::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 2

Define the function to convert directly from Fahrenheit to Celsius,
by reusing these two functions above

```r
fahr_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
  temp_k <- fahr_to_kelvin(temp)
  result <- kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k)
  return(result)
}
```
